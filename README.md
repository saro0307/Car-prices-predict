## Installation

To run the Car Price Prediction program locally or in your own Colab environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or open it in Google Colab.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter notebook `car_price_prediction.ipynb` in Google Colab or a Jupyter notebook environment.

3. Follow the instructions and code within the notebook to train and evaluate the car price prediction model.

## Usage

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to build a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques. You can use the provided Jupyter notebook `car_price_prediction.ipynb` as a guide to understand the following:

- Data preprocessing and exploration.
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Building, training, and evaluating regression models.
- Making predictions and analyzing model performance.

Feel free to adapt the code and techniques to your specific dataset or use case.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is available in the `data` folder. It contains car-related features such as mileage, year, engine size, and more, along with their corresponding prices. You can replace this dataset with your own data if needed.

## Model

This project employs various regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression, to predict car prices. Model performance metrics and evaluation are discussed in the notebook.
